                    <h3>Alex, our nomadic Chef</h3>
                    <p>"After studying Culinary Art in France and spending a decade as a travelling Chef, experiencing some of the best food the world has to offer, I settled in beautiful Freo six years ago.</p> 
                    <p>Being an outdoor and adventure enthusiast with a passion for food, I always bake a “Veggie Paté” to take on hikes with my mates. Over the years it has become too good not to share it with you!</p>
                    <p>I hope you enjoy it as much as we do!"</p>
