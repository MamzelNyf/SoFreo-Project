After a decade as a travelling Chef, I settled in beautiful Fremantle six years ago.</p> 
                        <p>Being an outdoor and adventure enthusiast with a passion for food, I always bake a “Veggie Paté” to take on hikes with my mates. Over the years it has become too good not to share it with you!</p>

                        <p>Back to Fremantle, we found an amazing community where we could experiment and live according to these values: being responsible and conscious regarding our planet, our people and our food!
                        <p>I currently study webdesign and with my background in graphic design, we were ready to launch our project: So Freo.</p>
                        <p>It's an adventure we are really happy to share with you."</p>
