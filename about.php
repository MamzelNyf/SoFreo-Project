                        <p>Being an outdoor and adventure enthusiast with a passion for food, I always bake a “Veggie Paté” to take on hikes with my mates. Over the years it has become too good not to share it with you!</p>
                        <p>I hope you enjoy it as much as we do!"</p>

                        <p>We travelled and hiked together for 1 year, sharing food, ideas and values! Back to Fremantle, I've started to study Webdesign and with my Graphic Designer background, we were ready to launch our project: So Freo.</p>
