                        <p>Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Privacy Policy, we do not collect information from visitors of the Website. </p>
                        <h4>When do we collect PI?</h4>
                        <p>We collect PI from you when you fill out a form, or otherwise enter PI, on the Website. </p>
                        <h4>How do we use your PI?</h4>

                        <li>For use in connection with our internal business for the purposes (e.g., to operate, evaluate, and improve the Website, our business, and the products and Services we offer or to develop new products or services; to analyse trends and statistics regarding use of the Services, product purchases and/or transactions conducted using the Services; etc.).
                        </li>

                        <p>We may combine the information we collect with publicly available information and information we may receive from our parent, affiliate, or subsidiary companies, business partners, and other third parties.

                        <p>So Freo Cuisine does not itself store or maintain PI, though the third-party email and other vendors we use to facilitate the hosting and provision of the Website/Services may do so. Please note that the electronic transmission of information is not completely secure. We cannot guarantee that the security measures such third-party vendors have in place to safeguard PI will never be defeated or fail, or that such measures will always be sufficient or effective. Any transmission of PI is at your own risk. </p>
                        <h4>What is a “cookie” and how do we use them? </h4>
                        <p>A “cookie” is a text file that the Website sends to a Website visitor’s computer or other internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store the information or settings in the browser.
